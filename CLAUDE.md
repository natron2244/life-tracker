## Architecture

This is a single-module Android app using Jetpack Compose and MVVM. State flows one way: `GameViewModel` holds all mutable state as `StateFlow<GameState>`, and Composables observe it via `collectAsState()`.

### Data Model
- `GameState` is the single root state object — it contains everything: player list, UI visibility flags (sheet open/closed), active dice result, and which player is targeted for commander damage or direct input.
- `Player` carries life total, poison counters, and a `Map<sourcePlayerId, damage>` for per-opponent commander damage.
- `PlayerColor` is an enum of the 6 Magic mana colors (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, Forest, Gold), each with a triple of primary/surface/onSurface colors used throughout the UI.

### ViewModel
`GameViewModel` is the only ViewModel. It handles:
- Setup flow (player count → names/colors → start game)
- All game mechanics (life adjust, commander damage, poison)
- Elimination detection — three loss conditions checked after every mutation: life ≤ 0, poison ≥ 10, single-source commander damage ≥ 21
- UI state toggles (dice roller sheet, commander damage sheet, direct input dialog, new game dialog)

### Navigation
Two-screen navigation in `AppNavigation.kt`: `setup` and `game`. Transitions are triggered by `LaunchedEffect` watching `gameState.gameStarted` and a `navigateToSetup` flag on `GameState`.

### UI Layout
`GameScreen` renders a dynamic grid that adapts for 2–6 players. Opposing player cards are rotated 180° so each player faces their own card. `LifeAdjustButton` implements tap-for-one / hold-for-continuous with acceleration after 500ms.
